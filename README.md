# iHub Swipe

This software is a java application developed by student employees at the Tom Love Innovation Hub at the University of Oklahoma. It is used to track visitors at the Tom Love Innovation Hub so that we can gain insights about what our visitors are doing, and keep track of their interactions with the Hub.

The applicaiton is written in Java, with a UI built in JavaFX. The backend is linked up to an AWS DynamoDB table to keep information updated between sign-in locations.
